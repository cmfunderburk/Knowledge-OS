# Modus Ponens

**Source:** Propositional Logic

## Statement

The fundamental rule of inference: from P and P → Q, conclude Q.

```text
P
P → Q
------
Q
```

## Key Insight

"Affirming the antecedent" - if the condition holds, the consequence follows.

Contrast with the fallacy of "affirming the consequent" (Q, P → Q ⊬ P).
