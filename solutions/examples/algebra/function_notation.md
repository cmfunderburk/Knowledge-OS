## Definition

A function is a relation where each input has exactly one output.

```text
f: A → B
f(x) = y means "f maps x to y"

The function f:
  - Domain: set of valid inputs
  - Codomain: set of possible outputs
  - Range: set of actual outputs (subset of codomain)
```

## Evaluating Functions

```text
Given f(x) = 2x² - 3x + 1

f(0) = 2(0)² - 3(0) + 1 = 1
f(2) = 2(4) - 3(2) + 1 = 8 - 6 + 1 = 3
f(a) = 2a² - 3a + 1
f(x+h) = 2(x+h)² - 3(x+h) + 1
       = 2x² + 4xh + 2h² - 3x - 3h + 1
```

## Vertical Line Test

A graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph at most once.
