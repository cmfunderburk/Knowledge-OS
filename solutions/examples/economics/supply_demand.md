# Supply and Demand

**Source:** Economics 3e, Chapter 3

## The Laws

```text
Law of Demand:
  Price ↑ → Quantity Demanded ↓
  (inverse relationship, ceteris paribus)

Law of Supply:
  Price ↑ → Quantity Supplied ↑
  (direct relationship, ceteris paribus)
```

## Equilibrium

```text
Equilibrium: Qd = Qs

At equilibrium price:
  - No surplus (Qs > Qd)
  - No shortage (Qd > Qs)
  - Market clears
```

## Shifts vs Movements

```text
Movement ALONG curve:
  - Caused by price change
  - Quantity changes, curve stays

Shift OF curve:
  - Caused by non-price factors
  - Entire curve moves left/right

Demand shifters: income, preferences, substitutes, complements, expectations
Supply shifters: input costs, technology, taxes, number of sellers
```

## Predicting Changes

```text
Demand ↑ (shift right): P↑, Q↑
Demand ↓ (shift left):  P↓, Q↓
Supply ↑ (shift right): P↓, Q↑
Supply ↓ (shift left):  P↑, Q↓
```
