# Operant Conditioning

**Source:** Psychology 2e, Chapter 6

## Overview

Operant conditioning is a learning process where behavior is modified by its consequences. Developed by B.F. Skinner, building on Thorndike's Law of Effect.

## Reinforcement & Punishment

```slots
Positive reinforcement :: Adding a desirable stimulus to increase behavior
Negative reinforcement :: Removing an aversive stimulus to increase behavior
Positive punishment :: Adding an aversive stimulus to decrease behavior
Negative punishment :: Removing a desirable stimulus to decrease behavior
```

## Key Insight

"Positive" and "negative" refer to adding or removing stimuli, not good or bad outcomes. Both reinforcement types increase behavior; both punishment types decrease it.
