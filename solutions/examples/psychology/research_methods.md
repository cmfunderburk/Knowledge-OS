# Research Methods

**Source:** Psychology 2e, Chapter 2

## Variables

```text
Independent Variable (IV): Manipulated by researcher
Dependent Variable (DV): Measured outcome
Confounding Variable: Uncontrolled factor affecting DV
```

## Research Designs

```text
Experimental:
  - Random assignment to groups
  - Manipulate IV, measure DV
  - Can establish causation

Correlational:
  - Measure existing variables
  - Find relationships
  - Cannot establish causation
  - Correlation ≠ Causation
```

## Correlation Coefficient

```text
r ranges from -1 to +1

r = +1: Perfect positive correlation
r = 0:  No correlation
r = -1: Perfect negative correlation

Strength:
  |r| < 0.3:  Weak
  |r| 0.3-0.7: Moderate
  |r| > 0.7:  Strong
```

## Common Biases

- **Selection bias:** Non-random sample
- **Confirmation bias:** Seeking confirming evidence
- **Placebo effect:** Expectation affects outcome
- **Experimenter bias:** Researcher influences results
