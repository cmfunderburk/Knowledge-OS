# Classical Conditioning

**Source:** Psychology 2e, Chapter 6

## Overview

Classical conditioning is a learning process where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus, eventually triggering a similar response.

Discovered by Ivan Pavlov through experiments with dogs.

## Key Terms

```text
Unconditioned Stimulus (US): Naturally triggers a response
Unconditioned Response (UR): Natural reaction to the US
Conditioned Stimulus (CS): Previously neutral, now triggers response
Conditioned Response (CR): Learned reaction to the CS
```

## Pavlov's Experiment

```text
Before conditioning:
  Food (US) → Salivation (UR)
  Bell (neutral) → No response

During conditioning:
  Bell + Food → Salivation

After conditioning:
  Bell (CS) → Salivation (CR)
```

## Related Phenomena

- **Extinction:** CR fades when CS presented without US
- **Spontaneous recovery:** CR reappears after rest period
- **Generalization:** Similar stimuli trigger CR
- **Discrimination:** Learning to distinguish between stimuli
