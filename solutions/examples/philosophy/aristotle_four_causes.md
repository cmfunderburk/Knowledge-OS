# Aristotle's Four Causes

**Source:** Physics II.3, Metaphysics I.3

## Overview

Aristotle's framework for complete explanation. To fully understand anything, you must identify four types of cause. This applies to natural objects, artifacts, and even abstract entities like mathematical objects.

## The Four Causes

```slots
Material cause :: What something is made of (the bronze of a statue)
Formal cause :: The pattern, form, or essence (the shape that makes it a statue)
Efficient cause :: The agent or process that brings it about (the sculptor's work)
Final cause :: The purpose, end, or "that for the sake of which" (to honor the subject)
```

## Key Insight

Modern science focuses almost exclusively on efficient causes—mechanisms, processes, "how" questions. Aristotle insisted that full understanding requires all four causes, especially the final cause (telos). For Aristotle, asking "what is it for?" is not anthropomorphizing nature but recognizing that natural things have intrinsic purposes.

## Distinguishing the Causes

```slots
"What is it made of?" :: Material cause
"What is its form or definition?" :: Formal cause
"What brought it into being?" :: Efficient cause
"What is it for?" :: Final cause
```

## Application to Ethics

When Aristotle analyzes human action, the final cause does the most explanatory work. We understand an action when we understand its aim. This is why the *Nicomachean Ethics* opens by asking: what is the ultimate aim of human life? The answer—eudaimonia—provides the final cause against which all virtues and actions are measured.

## Common Confusion

The four causes are not four separate things but four aspects of explanation. A single explanation might invoke all four: "The statue is bronze (material), shaped as Athena (formal), carved by Phidias (efficient), to honor the goddess (final)."
