3. **Read:** One Reader session per day (30-45 min)
4. **Create:** Turn insights into drill cards
5. **Evening:** Quick drill of any new cards

## Notes

- Adjust pace based on retention. If cards keep resetting to Box 0, slow down.
- Use priority shifts (`plan/study_config.yaml`) for intensive focus periods.
- The goal is durable understanding, not speed.
